- Unit Testing
- Git
- Basic Linux
- Continuous Integration
- Cloud Fundamentals

- Angular Web Development (Stretch Goal)

## Additional requirements and constraints

My database must contain at least 2 different tables.

The following technology must be used:
- Kanban Board: Trello or an equivalent Kanban Board
- Database: Azure Virtual Machine
- Programming languages: C# & Javascript (Stretch Goal)
- Unit Testing with C#
- Front-end: ASP.NET (Angular as a stretch goal)
- Version Control: Git
- CI Server: Azure DevOps
- Cloud server: Azure App Service

# My Approach

To achieve this, I have decided to produce a simple application for church leaders to record details of new members, so they can be allocated to the appropriate Bacenta according to their location. 

The app must be able to do the following:

### 1. Create en entry for a member profile (satisfies 'Create') that stores:
- Member ID
- First and Last Name
- Phone number
- Bacenta ID

### 2. View and update their profile details (satisfies 'Read' and 'Update')

### 3. Delete their profile (satisfies 'Delete')

### 4. Read entries of member profiles previously created (satisfies 'Read')

Additionally, I would like to allow the member profile to:

### 5. Link to a Bacenta profile which can be viewed containing:
- Bacenta ID
- Bacenta Name
- Leader First and Last Name
- Bacenta Type
- Location
- Branch
